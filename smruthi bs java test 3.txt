be collection types hirechcy.what are the main interfaces.what are diffrence between them
iterable is the supermost interfaces
collection  extends iterable
collect has sub  4 interfaces
list set queue sorted set
set is implimenentwd by two classes hashset and linked hash set 
list is implimented by two classes arraylist and linkedlist
sorted set and queue is implimented by treeset
set has hashset and linked hashset
set does not allow duplicates
set has only iterator and no other iterator
list has arraylist and linked list
list allow duplicates
list has list iterator


3 diff between hashset and treeset
hashset allows null value
treeset does not allow null
hashset uses hashtable
tree set uses tree structure
hashset does not maintain order
tree set maintain order

 10 Dependency Injection in Java is a way to achieve Inversion of control (IoC) in the application by moving objects 
binding from compile time to runtime.
We can achieve IoC through Factory Pattern,Template Method Design Pattern, Strategy Pattern and 
Service Locator pattern.

@componentscan used to find bean
@Autowired annotatiion is used to inject bean in spring

12
@component is used to manage object by spring
we add @component above the class spring we create bean for that class
